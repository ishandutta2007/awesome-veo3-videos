## Cases

### Case 1
- **Source:** [@ZHO_ZHO_ZHO](https://x.com/ZHO_ZHO_ZHO/status/1925074523768115281)
- **Prompt:** "A dynamic camera glides through a miniature LEGO world, where an epic adventure unfolds. All sound effects—footsteps, explosions, cars, dragons—are created using mouth sounds by a single AI-generated voice artist.
As each sound is made, the visuals instantly respond: LEGO characters jump into action, cars race, spaceships take off, volcanoes erupt. The journey moves through LEGO-built environments—city streets, underwater ruins, space stations, and lava lairs.
The video is fast-paced, playful, and visually rich, like a blend between The LEGO Movie and next-gen AI storytelling. The sound-to-visual sync creates a magical, toy-driven universe where imagination controls reality."
